**I like helping people by solving interesting problems and making cool stuff.**

## My Approach

- **Cross-Discipline Mindset:** I use ideas from physics and mathematics to find novel solutions to difficult problems.
- **Ownership and Adaptability:** I take ownership of outcomes, building deep understanding from first principles and treating challenges as opportunities to grow.
- **Shared Understanding:** I'm committed to intentional mentorship and making complex knowledge easily accessible.

## My Interests

### Programming

My strongest language is Python, though I also work with Rust, JavaScript, C++, and other
languages. Beyond writing code, I have professional experience with testing, DevOps, feature planning, and
UX.

### Physics and Mathematics

My main interest is foundational theory, particularly in geometric approaches to quantum gravity including [geometrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrodynamics) and [noncommutative geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncommutative_geometry).

### Education

I enjoy teaching and mentoring others. Through my [blog](/blog) and other content, I aim to visualize complex ideas and make their core concepts accessible to everyone.

### Game Dev

I first experimented with game dev after receiving a copy of [QuickBASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickBASIC) on a CD in junior high. Since then, I've built demos in various languages and remain interested in creating larger projects using [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), [Bevy](https://bevy.org/), or [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php).
