# Hi, I'm Scott Fredericks

<!-- ![(Profile Picture)](/img/main/profile.jpg) {: style="text-align:center;max-width:25%;margin:auto"} -->

**I like solving interesting problems and making cool stuff** {: style="text-align:center"}

## My Approach

I use code, math, and intuition to find creative solutions to challenging problems. In a highly specialized and rapidly changing world, adaptability is essential. Leveraging a variety of backgrounds makes you better at finding, creating, and using the right tools.

## My Interests

### Programming

My main language is Python, but I've also worked with JavaScript, C++, and other languages. I'm currently learning Rust and TypeScript/React for personal projects, and would like to use them in production.

I also have professional experience with testing, DevOps, feature planning, and UX.

### Physics and Mathematics

As a physicist, my main interest is in foundational theory, particulary in generalizing [geometrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrodynamics) to describe quantum interactions.

I would also like to better understand [noncommuatative geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncommutative_geometry) and its potential applications.

For my masters thesis, I authored [PyXtal](https://pyxtal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a Python library for use in computational molecular crystallography. I also published [an article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010465520304057) outlining the work.
