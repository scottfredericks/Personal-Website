title: Scott Fredericks - About Me

# Hi! I'm Scott Fredericks

**I like solving interesting problems and making cool stuff** {: style="text-align:center"}

## My Approach

I use physics, math, and code to find creative solutions to challenging problems. In a highly specialized and rapidly changing world, adaptability is essential. Leveraging a variety of backgrounds helps you find and create better tools and use them more effectively.

Physics has taught me that when you truly understand a problem, the solution follows naturally. My passion is modeling complex systems in a way that produces generalized solutions, but preserves the nuance that makes such systems worth studying in the first place. 

See [my projects](/projects) for some examples of what I've worked on.

## My Interests

### Programming

I like to focus on creating systems, but I also enjoy designing and implementing end-to-end features. I have a soft spot for fine details in UI and UX work.

My main language is Python, but I also have experience with JavaScript, C++, and Lua. I'm also learning Rust and TypeScript/React for personal projects. I'm generally eager to adopt new languages and technologies as needed.

I have dedicated experience with testing, and like to take a test-driven approach to development. If you plan to do something more than once, automate it.

See [my experience](/experience) for more info on my development background.
