# Hi! I'm Scott Fredericks

**I like solving interesting problems and making cool stuff.** {: style="text-align:center"}

<section class="approach">

## My Approach

I use code, math, and intuition to find creative solutions to challenging
problems. I've found that leveraging a variety of backgrounds helps with finding the right tools and adapting in a rapidly changing world.

As a lifelong learner, I strive to thoroughly document my findings and share them in an accessible way. Fostering a culture of mentorship and collaboration is very important to me.

## My Interests

### Programming

My main language is Python, but I've also worked with Rust, JavaScript, C++, and other
languages. I have professional experience with testing, DevOps, feature planning, and
UX.

### Physics and Mathematics

My main interest is foundational theory, particularly in geometric approaches to quantum gravity including [geometrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrodynamics) and [noncommutative geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncommutative_geometry).

### Education

I regularly spend time teaching and mentoring others. I have a [blog](/blog), and I'd like to begin creating educational content focused on making technical topics easy to understand.

### Game Dev

I've experimented with game dev since I first got a copy of [QuickBASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickBASIC) from a CD in junior high. Since then I've made game demos in various languages, and I'd like to work on larger projects.
