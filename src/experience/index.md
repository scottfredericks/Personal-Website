# Experience

## Background

I use physics, math, and code to find creative solutions to challenging problems. In a highly specialized and constantly changing world, the ability to adapt is key. Having a wide range of knowledge and experience lets you not only find the best tools, but also develop new and better ones.

Physics has taught me that when you truly understand a problem, the solution follows naturally. My passion is modeling complex systems in a way that produces generalized solutions, but preserves the nuance that makes such systems worth studying in the first place.
