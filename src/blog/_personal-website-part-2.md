# Building a Personal Website - Part 2: Designing a Theme

_Good to know before reading: basic HTML/CSS, basic JavaScript, editing files_

## Inspiration

The layout for my old website was a bit boring. I generally like simplicity and neutral
tones, but I wanted more individuality and better use of accents. I also wanted
to combine the unique parts of my background in a sleek, modern way.

I've had Alaska on my mind lately, and being
[Unangax̂](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleuts) (an Alaska native from the
Aleutian islands, AKA "Aleut"), I wanted to see if I could incorporate some of
the traditional art style into the design.

This style uses a few traditional colors including black, red, teal, white, and
to a lesser extent brown or faded orange as a stand-in for wood or hide. The
shapes tend to be large, swirling, almost psychadelic patterns that ending in
curves, spirals, or sharp points. Here's a traditional hunting hat to give you
the general idea:

At the same time, I wanted to give a modern sense of digitality and general
"computer-y-ness", with some inspiration from physics and computational science.
I also really like the simplicity of a dark theme with a gradient, as
demonstrated in
[Brittany Chang's portfolio website](https://brittanychiang.com/).

I ended up with some JavaScript code to procedurally generate a maze-like
pattern with traditional Aleut colors. I also decided to add a dark gradient
over the top to reduce the sense of clutter, and to use light brown as an accent
color in the foreground. This background can be rendered in a canvas element in
the background, with the rendering logic in a separate script file.
