    <p>I use physics, math, and code to find creative solutions to challenging problems.
      In a highly specialized and constantly changing world, the ability to adapt is key.
      Having a wide range of knowledge and experience lets you not only find the best tools,
      but also develop new and better ones.
    </p>
    <p>Physics has taught me that when you truly understand a problem, the solution follows naturally.
      My passion is modeling complex systems in a way that produces generalized solutions, but preserves the
      nuance that makes such systems worth studying in the first place.

          <h4>Test Engineering Manager / Technical Support Engineer</h4>
          <p>Starting as a technical support engineer, I helped clients build solutions for their industrial automation problems.
            This included programming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_controller">PLCs</a> using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladder_logic">ladder logic</a>, designing touchscreen interfaces, writing scripts in various languages, and troubleshooting inter-device communication.
            I also wrote and edited technical documents including manuals, product catalogs, website pages, and blog articles.</p>
          <p>I was eventually promoted to the dev team as a software test engineer.
            There, I designed and executed tests covering the complete range of features for the product.
            Alongside other developers, I helped design and review new features based on my experience in tech support.
            Additionally, I developed a custom Python framework to generate desktop installers for Windows and Mac.
          </p>
          <p>After a series of promotions, I became the Test Engineering Manager. In this role, I helped guide the company's testing strategy and managed other test engineers.</p>

          <h4>Graduate Research Assistant</h4>
          <p>My masters degree was funded by a research assistantship in computational crystallography. For this, I created an
            open-source Python library called<a href="https://pyxtal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">PyXtal</a>(pronounced "Pie-Crystal").
            PyXtal can generate randomized molecular or atomic crystal structures based on user-defined symmetry. I learned to efficiently write, document, test, optimize, and package code for scientific use.
            I also <a href="https://github.com/SchedMD/slurm">deployed the code on a remote supercomputing cluster</a>,
            published<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010465520304057">a paper</a>documenting the results,
            and gave numerous presentations.</p>

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>(just a few of them)</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>AI Tools</h3>
    <p>Recently I've been looking into creating AI workflows for using LLMs within code repos.
      This includes defining "roles" (e.g. design, architecture, review, QA) for making multiple passes through proposed changes.
      I also want to see how a test-driven development approach can be better facilitated by focusing on testability and modularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Definining and retrieving long-term context is a critical challenge for real-world projects.
      Using a heirarchical file-driven approach (similar to what <a href="https://aider.chat/">aider</a> uses, but focused on context instead of just code) seems promising.
    </p>
    <h3>Indie Game Developement</h3>
    <p>I've been interested in hobby game dev since junior high.
      I first got started using a copy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickBASIC">QuickBASIC</a> obtained from a CD, and have tinkered with different languages and frameworks over the years.
    </p>
    <h3>Theoretical Physics</h3>
    <p>As a physicist, my main interest is in foundational theory, particulary in
      generalizing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrodynamics">geometrodynamics</a> to describe quantum interactions.
      It looks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncommutative_geometry">noncommutative geometry</a> may be a suitable framework for this.
    </p>
    <h3>Educational Content and Curation</h3>
    <p>Education and educational content creation have been on my mind for a while.
      Most material and tools focus on simply presenting the material, but tend to do a poor job of helping students understand the underlying concepts.
      I also think there is a gap in educational software - the potential to use interactivity to teach advanced concepts (especially in math and physics) seems relatively untapped.
